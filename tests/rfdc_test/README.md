# RFDC Test

This design used the DAC replay IP to drive the I and Q DAC inputs on DAC Tile XXX blocks X and X. The output can be verified in lab with a spectrum anlyzer / oscilloscpe. The caputre subsystem enables capturing of the ADC values. The design can be used to caputre the DAC output to the ADCs in loopback mode or a lab signal generator can be used to measure the ADC SFDR and verify performance.
